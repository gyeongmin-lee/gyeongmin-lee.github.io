## About Myself

Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Min, a software engineer with experience in Front-end development and AWS. I'm passionate about using technology to address real-world issues. I'm currently looking for a full-time position in British Columbia.

In my spare time, I enjoy researching front-end frameworks and how they can be used to build better user experiences. I also enjoy reading books on software development and personal growth. Some of my favourites are [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4099.The_Pragmatic_Programmer) and [Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44882.Code).

I graduated with a diploma in Computer Systems Technology from BCIT in 2020, concentrating in Web Development and Cloud Computing. I gained extensive practical experience through various projects.

Other things I enjoy (in no particular order): bass guitar, skateboarding, Manchester United, lego, and bible study.
